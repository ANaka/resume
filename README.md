Mark's Résumé
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MurphyMarkW/resume.svg?branch=current)](https://travis-ci.org/MurphyMarkW/resume)

Hey there! This is my resume. Why is it sitting in git? Well, because it's written in LaTeX source code, and source code belongs in a version controlled repository! Also, I wanted to automate the build and deploy process to ensure I could repeatedly build my resume. Not much use if I can't turn it into a pdf! :)
